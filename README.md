# call-records-organizer
This is a fun project I did to organize my father's phone call records. This is a Python script that organizes call record files based on names found in their filenames. Uses regular expression to extract the caller’s name, creates folders automatically, and moves each file to the correct location for a cleaner and more organized structure.
